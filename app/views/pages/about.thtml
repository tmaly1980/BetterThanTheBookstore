<h1 class="title">About</h1>

<p class="maintext">BTTB was started in 2006 at Penn out of a desire to make a bad textbook situation better.&nbsp; Since then we&rsquo;ve kept thousands of books in circulation on campus, and have saved the Penn community tons of money.&nbsp; We continue to work with House of Our Own Bookstore (3920 Spruce St) at Penn, the wonderful place where BTTB began.</p>
