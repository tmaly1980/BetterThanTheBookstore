<h1 class="title">Work With Us</h1>

<p class="maintext">We are always looking for help in a variety of capacities.  We have two staple operational positions for which we always need several excellent people: BTTB site managers and BTTB messengers.  The BTTB site managers handle book check-ins and drop-offs at House of Our Own Bookstore during the peak book buying/selling times (the first several weeks of each semester).  BTTB messengers are in charge of delivering books to/picking books up from those people who choose the book delivery option.  Both positions are paid.</p>
<p class="maintext">See our <a href="http://www.betterthanthebookstore.com/pages/ethics">Ethics</a> for more on the BTTB work spirit and shoot an email to <a href="emailto:work@betterthanthebookstore.com">work@betterthanthebookstore.com</a> if you are interested in joining us.</p>  
<p class="maintext">If you are interested in joining us in another capacity, let us know what you have in mind at <a href="emailto:work@betterthanthebookstore.com">work@betterthanthebookstore.com</a>.</p>
