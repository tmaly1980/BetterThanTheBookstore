<h1 class="title">Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="maintext">BetterThanTheBookstore.com collects personal information (name, UPenn email address, Penncard ID number, and phone number) from its users in order to ensure a smooth and hassle-free service.  We keep all of this information strictly confidential and will not share this information with any third party except if required by court or governmental requirement.</p>

<p class="maintext">The only information which is available to the public regarding the user is the username which the user chooses.  In the interest of the user’s security, the registration process prohibits the username from being identical to the user’s email address (for example, if the user’s email address is johnq@sas.upenn.edu, the user is prohibited from choosing “johnq” as a username).  For added security, we recommend that the user pick a username that lends itself towards further anonymity (for example: “stargazer,” or “aprilfool29”).</p>

<p class="maintext">BetterThanTheBookstore.com uses the services of PayPal for processing payments.  For more about PayPal, please visit <a href="http://www.PayPal.com" target="_blank">www.PayPal.com</a>.  We are not responsible for the errors or omissions of PayPal.</p>

<p class="maintext">This privacy policy is subject to change and changes to it become valid upon being posted here.</p>
